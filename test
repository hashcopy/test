Title: Business Logic Bypass Enables Unauthorized Modification of Contribution Date via Request Interception
Description:
The application suffers from a business logic flaw that allows unauthorized modification of the contribution date field through request manipulation. Although the contribution date is intentionally non-editable in the user interface, attackers can intercept and modify the API request using tools like Burp Suite to assign an arbitrary date to contributions.

This vulnerability stems from inadequate validation of critical fields on the server side. As a result, users can bypass the intended business logic, leading to potential data inconsistencies, fraudulent entries, and abuse of system workflows.

Recommendation:
Enforce Strong Server-Side Validation: Ensure that the server validates all incoming requests, especially for fields that are not editable in the user interface, to confirm compliance with business rules.

Mark Immutable Fields as Non-Editable: For fields like the contribution date that are not intended to be changed, implement controls to reject any client-side or intercepted attempts to modify them.

Implement Endpoint Restrictions: Design API endpoints to align with the application's intended functionality. Disallow any field modifications that are not explicitly permitted by the business logic.

Audit Requests for Anomalies: Track all requests and identify unauthorized attempts to manipulate sensitive fields. These logs should be monitored regularly to detect and prevent misuse.

Perform Regular Business Logic Testing: Incorporate testing for business logic bypass vulnerabilities during development and security assessments to identify similar issues proactively.

Addressing these recommendations will reinforce the application's business rules and prevent users from bypassing restrictions, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the system.
