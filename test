Title: Business Logic Bypass Allows Modification of Non-Editable Contribution Date via Request Manipulation
Description:
The application contains a business logic flaw that permits modification of the contribution date, a field explicitly marked as non-editable in the user interface. By intercepting and manipulating API requests using tools such as Burp Suite, an attacker can alter the contribution date to arbitrary values.

This vulnerability results from inadequate server-side enforcement of immutability for sensitive fields. While the user interface prevents changes, the server does not validate the immutability of the contribution date when processing requests. This discrepancy between the client-side controls and server-side validation allows attackers to bypass business logic restrictions.

Impact:

Data Integrity Compromise: Unauthorized changes to the contribution date can misrepresent historical records.
Fraudulent Activity: Attackers could potentially exploit this flaw to falsify contribution timelines for financial or reputational gains.
Loss of Trust: The lack of robust controls over critical data undermines user confidence in the system's reliability.
Steps to Reproduce:
Navigate to the feature or section of the application where the contribution date is displayed.
Observe that the field is non-editable in the user interface.
Intercept the request using a proxy tool like Burp Suite when performing an action related to contributions.
Modify the contribution_date parameter in the intercepted request to a different value.
Forward the modified request to the server.
Verify that the contribution date has been updated to the manipulated value, despite being marked as non-editable in the UI.
Recommendation:
Enforce Server-Side Immutability:

Implement strict server-side checks to ensure that non-editable fields like the contribution date cannot be modified, regardless of client-side behavior.
Reject any requests containing updates to such fields with an appropriate error response.
Consistent Validation Across Layers:

Align client-side and server-side controls by validating critical fields in both layers to prevent inconsistencies.
Harden API Endpoints:

Design API endpoints to explicitly disallow modifications to immutable fields.
Employ a whitelist of permissible changes for each request to ensure that unintended fields cannot be altered.
Audit Logging and Monitoring:

Implement detailed logging for all API interactions, capturing field modifications and user actions.
Monitor logs for unauthorized attempts to alter immutable fields and raise alerts for suspicious activity.
Penetration Testing for Business Logic Flaws:

Include business logic validation in routine security assessments to proactively identify and remediate similar issues.
Conclusion:
By addressing this business logic bypass, the application will ensure that non-editable fields remain immutable, protecting data integrity and maintaining the trust of its users.
